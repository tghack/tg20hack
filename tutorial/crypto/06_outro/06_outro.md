# Outro

Congratulations, you have completed TG:Hack's crypto tutorial! We hope we
managed to give you a small glimpse into the world of encryption and that you
got some helpful tips for solving those horrifying crypto tasks. 

Cryptography is a big topic with many subjects, some easy to use and
understand, and others not. We strongly encourage you to go out and learn more,
even if it's just to get an overview of what's out there. An essential skill when
participating in CTFs is to be able to find information that helps you solve
the challenges you face. Even just being familiar with some different topics
can make that process easier, therefore we leave you with some resources if
you feel like exploring a bit.

A great tool that we use ourselves when we want to solve other CTF tasks, and
sometimes when we create tasks for you:

An actual course in cryptography filmed and put up on YouTube.  As this is
university level material, not everyone will find the whole course informative.
The first few videos is a good introduction that anyone could watch.
